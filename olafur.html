POSTERS INSPIRED BY ARTIST ALMIR MAVIGNIER<br>
<br>
This project was made in the curricular unit of Communication Design I of the 1st year of the course. We were asked to choose and study an artist of our taste and then make a poster that had the main characteristics of this artist's work. The artist I chose was Almir Mavignier, this artist used to make several posters for other artists for several exhibitions in museums and art galleries, so I decided that my poster would be just that, an advertising poster for an art exhibition. <br>
At the time I was doing this work, I knew that there was going to be an exhibition at the Serralves Museum in Porto of the artist Olafur Eliasson, and so my poster would be to advertise that.<br>
The central drawing of this poster represents in a discreet way one of Olafur Eliasson's works.<br>
