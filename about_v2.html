Hello, my name is Patr√≠cia Penela, I'm 22 years old and I'm in the 2nd year of a degree in Communication Design.<br>
I started my university path in 2017 but in a completely different area, I was studying Business Management but when I finished the course I didn't feel like a fulfilled person and so I started to think about how my life would be, I thought about all the curricular units that I had in the Management course and one of my favorites was Marketing and then I thought, I'm going to take a Master's in Digital Marketing but in the middle of all my research about the course I discovered Communication Design and this immediately captivated my attention because I consider myself a very creative person, who likes challenges and to explore new ideas. So, I decided to take another degree in Communication Design.<br>
Besides this recently discovered taste for design I still have another passion which is photography. I've been photographing for some time but I never looked at photography as something I could do professionally, but the taste kept growing and growing until I started to explore new things in photography and to be called to do some photo sessions. To work with photography and design.<br>
In both areas my path may still be short, but even though it is short it has been an adventure that I am loving.<br>
I hope you enjoy exploring my projects to the fullest.<br>
Kisses.
